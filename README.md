## Udacity - Predicting Bike Sharing Data

This project builds and creates a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Installation
Download anaconda or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and create a new conda environment.
`conda create --name bikesharing python=3`

Enter your new environment:
- Mac/Linux: >> `source activate bikesharing`
- Windows: >> `activate bikesharing`

Install dependencies:
`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

## Usage Example
From your project directory:
`jupyter notebook`

In your browser, open `my_first_neural_network.ipynb`
Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the `my_answers.py` python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
